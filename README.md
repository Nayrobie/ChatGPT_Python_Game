# I used ChatGPT to create an entire video game with Python

## üéÆ What is it About?


OpenAI just released **ChatGPT** , a new language model that can chat with you, give you detailed answers to inquiries, and even help with programming.

I wanted to test the limits of this **new AI bot** and see if **chatGPT** could be a good **pair programmer** for **designing video games**. I wondered how well the AI bot can help game design learners build their own video game, I believe that with some help, anyone can build their own games.

### Description of the Project


`Pygame` is an open source `Python` programming language library for making video games. It's not a game development platform like Unity or Unreal Engine which are very popular among game designers. Pygame is easy to install lightweight, but has a lot of limitations and is better suited for light video games such as a `2D platformer.` Unlike the popular game engines, when using Pygame, every aspect of the game needs to be written in a line of code, which can quickly become tedious. That's why I wanted `chatGPT` to provide some help.

### Let‚Äôs Get Started!


First of all, I checked if ChatGPT can help:

That's a good start. I then asked the bot to create the **basic structure of code for the game**. He gave me a few lines of code, importing the pygame library, setting up the game window, the game loop that starts the game; fill the screen with a colour and stops the game when you quit.

### Building the background and the player


I used the code from ChatGPT with a few modifications and continued with the background. I wanted a depth effect, so I chose a parallax background (it has 4 layers that moves at different speed depending on how far they are from the player). I had to learn from *[Coding With Russ](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRuss)* on YouTube.   
Then I incorporated the player that I wanted to animate, for this I used a sprite sheet. ChatGPT helped with the event handling of the game, to associate the animation frames to actual keys pressed by the player. I gradually added some of ChatGPT lines of code, then made some changes, and he helped with fixing bugs.

### Optimising the code


When the code got a bit messy, I asked ChatGPT how to optimise it.
